# Objective

We are working on a chat application and the engineering team has recently
completed the backend. It is our job to build a frontend that has the ability
to send and receive messages and provide an appropriate user experience for
doing so.

This application is an anonymous chat server. Upon connecting, you will be given
a fake name and can immediately chat with others who are connected.
The server operates over WebSockets. The code that handles the messages from
the server is already written as Redux middleware and can be found in the
`chatMiddleware.js` file. This is simply for your information - you will not
be expected to modify this file. The remainder of the application has been stubbed
out and you are free to change anything you like. While working on the challenge,
you may use anything that you normally would while working (Google, StackOverflow,
installing additional packages, etc) and should not feel like you are "cheating".

The design of the frontend is left up to you, both from a code and UI perspective.
The objective for the end of the session is to have at least some chunk of functionality
complete. We are looking for strong navigation of the problem statement and weighing
of potential solutions, clean and readable code with good separation of concerns, and
good communication on design decisions, road blocks, issues, etc. We are **not** looking
for total completion of the application, hyper optimized code, or a display of mastery
in a particular language / framework. Although parts of the non-goals are nice to have,
we will not be evaluating on them in this session.
